<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## How it was made

Rocket Bank was my second attempt at building a mobile application, my first was [Uber Clone](https://github.com/rafae2k/uber-clone).

- Used GitHub projects to build an automated Kanban board, by creating issues/TODOs
  - requirements
  - design
  - components
  - screens
  - logic
  - issues/bugs

<p float='center'>

</p>

Then the cards were moved to the next stage soon as I opened the Pull Request and then moved to the next stage when the Pull Request was merged into the main branch.

- The standardization of the project was done with:
  - **_Commitlint_** to check the commit message following Angular's style.
  - **_lint-staged_** to ensure that no ESlint or TypeScript errors we're committed.
  - **_Prettier_** to format the code following the **_ESlint_** config.

### Built With

- üéØ [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- üì≤ [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- üíÖ [Styled-components](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- üß© [Expo](https://www.expo.dev)
- ‚õµÔ∏è [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- ü¶ô [Alpaca Market Data](https://https://alpaca.markets//)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- PROBLEMS FACED -->

### Difficulties

- Learn and understand **_react navigation_** lib and how to work with nested screens and routes and correctly type them.

- **_Typescript types_** and **_Eslint_** rules and configuration

- **_Styled-components:_** was difficult to know that some styles didn't work on native that I was used on web development, like `gap` and different implementations of `flex`.

- Work with native components like, `FlatList` and `ScrollView`, `KeyboardAvoidingView`, as the project was becoming more complex, and nesting components generated errors, like `ScrollView` inside a `ScrollView`.

- **_Debugging:_** was difficult to understand how to debug the app styles and state and set up flipper to work with Expo.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Expo Snack - Test the app on web or on your phone.

[Click Here to run the app on Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@rafae2k/694e1f)

- You can run on the Web emulator of Expo Snack only on iOS or Android (Web doesn't work yet for this project) or on your device by reading the QR code and run on Expo Go App.

***ATENTION***
Although this app is multiplatform, it was only tested on iOS, so some functionalities may not work correctly 

### Prerequisites

This project use `yarn` as package manager, you can still use others managers as `npm`.

To enable `yarn` follow this steps.

```sh
corepack enable
```

You also need to install the `expo-cli`

```sh
yarn global add expo-cli
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rafae2k/rocketbank-mobile.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. start expo
   ```sh
   expo start
   ```
4. Running on your phone

   press `c` on the terminal and read the QR code with the Expo GO app installed or press `i` to run on the iOS emulator (only available on macOS) or `a` to run on the Android emulator
   
5. Login 
   
   This app doesn't have a real authentication check in addition to Hardware Biometrics Authentication, but some business logic we're added, so the first time you open the app, you need to enter a valid email and a password with at least 8 characters, after that, every time you open the app you'll be automatically logged in with Hardware Biometrics (Face ID/Fingerprint).
   
   
### Know Issues

- Links on `Home` don't work at first, you need to manually navigate do account and market bottom tabs to buttons on `Homescreen` correctly navigate to screens.

- Back button on the header of `BottonTab's (Navbar)` screens navigate to the login page because the index route stack, and other nested `screens (Stacks)` work correctly keeping navigation history and with the back button returning to the last page that user navigated.
