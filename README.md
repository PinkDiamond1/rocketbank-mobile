<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## How it was made

Rocket Bank was my second attempt at building a mobile application, my first was [Uber Clone](https://github.com/rafae2k/uber-clone).

- Used github projects to build an automated Kanban board, by creating issues/TODO's
  - requirements
  - design
  - components
  - screens
  - logic
  - issues/bug's

<p float='center'>

</p>

That where being moved to the next stage soon as i opened the Pull Request, and then moved to the next stage when the Pull Request was merged into main branch.

- The standardization of the project was done with:
  - **_Commitlint_** to check the commit message following Angular's style.
  - **_lint-staged_** to ensure no lint or TypeScript errors are committed.
  - **_Prettier_** to format the code following the **_ESlint_** Standard.

### Built With

- üéØ [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- üì≤ [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- üíÖ [Styled-components](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- üß© [Expo](https://www.expo.dev)
- ‚õµÔ∏è [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- ü¶ô [Alpaca Market Data](https://https://alpaca.markets//)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- PROBLEMS FACED -->

### Problems

- Learn and understand **_react navigation_** lib and how to work with nested screens and routes and correctly type it.

- **_Typescript types_** and **_Eslint_** rules and configuration

- **_Styled-components:_** was difficult to know that some styles didn't work on native that I was used on web development, like `gap` and different implementation of `flex`.

- Work with native components like, `FlatList` and `ScrollView`, `KeyboardAvoidingView`, as much the project was becoming more complex, and nesting components generated errors, like `ScrollView` inside a `ScrollView`.

- **_Debugging:_** was difficult to understand how to debug the app styles and state and setup flipper to work with expo.
